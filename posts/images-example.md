# Adding Images to Your Blog

You can easily add images to your markdown posts!

## External Images

Just use a regular markdown image syntax with a URL:

![Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300/0066cc/ffffff?text=External+Image)

## Local Images

1. Put images in the `public/images/` directory
2. Reference them like this: `![Alt text](/images/filename.jpg)`

Images are automatically styled to be responsive and fit within the content area.

## Image Best Practices

- Use descriptive alt text for accessibility
- Optimize images before uploading (compress them)
- Use web-friendly formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Keep file sizes reasonable for fast loading
