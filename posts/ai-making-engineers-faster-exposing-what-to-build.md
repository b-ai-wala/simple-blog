# AI Isn't Just Making Engineers Faster—It's Exposing What They Should Be Building Instead

Here's a question that should make every engineering leader uncomfortable: How much of your team's code from the last sprint is actually being used?

Not deployed. Not shipped. **Actually used.**

Because here's what I'm seeing happen across companies adopting AI coding tools: Engineering productivity isn't just going up. The entire conversation about what engineers should be doing is getting turned on its head.

And it's exposing an uncomfortable truth that's been hiding in plain sight for years.

## The Productivity Theater We're Running

For the past decade, we've measured engineering success with metrics that sound smart but mean nothing:

- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Throughput**: Pull requests merged per week
- **Deployment frequency**: How often we ship to production

Here's what none of these metrics tell you: **Did anyone actually use what you built?**

I've watched teams celebrate shipping features that get 2% adoption. I've seen sprints where engineers spend two weeks building something that Product changes their mind about the day it launches.

We optimize for shipping code. Not for shipping value.

And nobody questions it because building is expensive. If it takes your team two weeks to build something, you ship it. Sunk cost fallacy dressed up as "execution."

AI is killing that excuse.

## What Actually Changes When Building Gets Cheap

When building goes from two weeks to two hours, something fundamental shifts:

**You can afford to be wrong.** Build three versions, test which one users actually want. Prototype Monday, kill it Tuesday when nobody cares.

**The bottleneck moves.** It's no longer "How fast can we code this?" It's "Are we building the right thing?"

**This exposes every organizational dysfunction you've been hiding behind "engineering capacity."**

## The Uncomfortable Questions AI Forces You to Answer

### Question 1: Why Are Engineers Building Things When The People Who Understand The Problem Can Build It Themselves?

Here's the traditional handoff game:
1. Customer success team identifies workflow problem
2. They write a feature request ticket
3. Product interprets it into requirements
4. Engineering builds what they think Product meant
5. Three weeks later, customer success sees it: "This isn't what we needed"

**What's happening now:**

Customer success person opens Cursor. Describes the workflow problem. AI builds a working prototype in 90 minutes. They test it with actual customers. Iterate based on real feedback. By the time Engineering sees it, the problem is solved—or proven not worth solving.

**The shift isn't "engineers get faster." It's "the people who understand the problem can now solve it directly."**

Why are we still routing everything through engineering when the sales team can prototype the dashboard they need? When operations can build the workflow automation they've been requesting for months? When finance can create the analytical tools instead of writing requirements docs?

The answer used to be "because they can't code." That answer just expired.

### Question 2: Why Are We Building Features Nobody Asked For?

Here's what AI makes possible: **Let users build rough versions of what they think they want. Then decide if it's worth engineering time.**

Old approach:
- Product: "Users want feature X"
- Engineering: 3 weeks of development
- Launch: 5% adoption, feature rot

New approach:
- Product: "Users might want feature X"
- Give power users AI tools to prototype it themselves
- See if they actually use their own prototypes
- If yes, engineering builds the production-grade version
- If no, you saved 3 weeks

When prototyping costs hours instead of weeks, you stop shipping features and start validating hypotheses.

## The Shift: From Code Velocity to Value Velocity

Here's what the best teams are figuring out:

**Old Metric: Story Points Completed**
**New Metric:** Hypotheses validated or invalidated

**Old Metric: Deployment Frequency**
**New Metric:** Time from idea to user feedback

**Old Metric: Code Coverage**
**New Metric:** Features users actually adopted

Every new metric requires knowing what users actually want and measuring whether they're getting value. That's hard. That's why we've avoided it and measured "velocity" instead.

AI is making velocity free. Now you have to do the hard work of figuring out what's worth building.

## What This Actually Means (And Why Most Organizations Aren't Ready)

AI isn't just making coding faster. It's revealing that **most engineering teams are optimized for shipping code, not shipping value.**

When code becomes cheap, you're forced to confront an uncomfortable reality: Do you actually know what's worth building?

The organizations that win won't be the ones with the most engineers. They'll be the ones who:

**Empower non-engineers to solve their own problems.** Sales builds dashboards. Operations builds automation. Customer success builds workflow tools. If it proves valuable, Engineering productionizes it. If not, nobody wasted engineering time.

**Kill half their roadmap.** When you can build in hours, you realize how much of your backlog is low-value cruft. Smart teams are cutting planned features by 50% and focusing on the 3-4 things that actually matter.

**Redefine roles, not just processes.** Product Managers become hypothesis generators, not spec writers. Engineers focus on production infrastructure, security, and scale—not building dashboards sales could prototype themselves. The person closest to the problem owns the first version.

But this only works if you trust non-technical people to build. And most organizations don't.

That's the real bottleneck AI exposes.

## What This Means For You

**If you're an Engineering Leader:**
Stop optimizing for velocity. Start optimizing for impact. How fast can your organization go from "maybe users want this" to "data proves they do/don't"?

**If you're a Product Manager:**
Your specs don't need to be perfect anymore. Empower teams to prototype their own solutions. Focus on identifying problems worth solving, not documenting solutions.

**If you're in Sales/CS/Ops/Finance:**
You have leverage you've never had before. You can prototype solutions to your own problems. Stop waiting for engineering capacity. Start building.

**If you're a Founder/CEO:**
Your engineering team can move 5x faster. But only if you restructure how decisions get made and who gets to build. If only engineers can prototype, you're wasting 90% of your AI leverage.

## The Bottom Line

AI coding tools aren't just making engineers more productive.

They're making shipping code so cheap that **shipping the right code is the only thing that matters.**

And most organizations are about to discover they have no idea what the "right code" actually is.

For years, we've hidden behind "engineering capacity" as the excuse. We couldn't build everything, so we built what leadership said to build. We measured velocity because measuring value was too hard.

AI is removing both excuses.

The teams that win aren't the ones that ship 5x more code.

They're the ones that ship 5x more code **that users actually want.**
