# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! This blog is built with Next.js and uses markdown files for content.

## Features

- Clean, minimal design
- Write in Markdown
- Fast and simple
- Easy to deploy on Vercel

## Getting Started

Just add `.md` files to the `posts` directory with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2024-01-15"
---

Your content here...
```

That's it! The blog will automatically pick up your posts and display them.
